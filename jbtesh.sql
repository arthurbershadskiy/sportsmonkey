He''s the leader of this team and he''s the guy from whom the rest of his teammates take their cues. He has to play at a very high level for the Bulls to have a chance in this series. He loves facing the Heat, but will he have enough gas in the tank to will his team the way he did against Brooklyn?\r\n\r\nTom Haberstroh, ESPN.com: Derrick Rose. But that doesn''t mean it''s fair. The last thing the Bulls need is their franchise player jeopardizing his career against the overwhelming Heat. Sitting out would be the right move if there''s a psychological hitch. Simply put, the risk isn''t worth the reward. We don''t want another Penny Hardaway situation on our hands.\r\n\r\nMatt McHale, Bulls By The Horns: Derrick Rose. He''s already taken a lot of criticism for not playing to this point. I imagine that criticism will only increase during this series. Of the players who are actually playing, probably Luol Deng, who will be tasked with trying to contain the league''s MVP.\r\n\r\nDanny Nowell, Portland Roundball: Is it too cute to say Derrick Rose? With obligatory nods to their guts and defense, I''m giving the Bulls very little chance of pulling the upset, and I suspect that every game they are outclassed by the Heat will turn up the pressure on Rose to return. This off-court issue has more drama than any on-court issue likely will.\r\n \r\n Michael Wallace, ESPN.com: Derrick Rose. Of course, this probably shouldn''t be the case because Rose has earned the benefit of any doubt. But neither Rose nor the Bulls are doing their franchise player any favors by refusing to announce he''s shut down for the playoffs. If they do so and he comes back, fine. No biggie.\r\n \r\n 2. Who faces the most pressure on the Heat?\r\n \r\nFriedell: Isn''t it always LeBron James? All eyes are always focused on James -- especially after he collected another MVP trophy Sunday. Coach Tom Thibodeau will have his defense focused on slowing down James at all times, and the Bulls have a history of playing the Miami superstar tough. Given the Heat''s recent history with the Bulls, James will surely try to break Chicago''s will early.\r\n \r\nHaberstroh: Chris Bosh. Keeping Joakim Noah off the boards and off his game will be the Heat''s No. 1 priority. It''s never a one-on-one ordeal, but Bosh''s presence underneath will be breathlessly scrutinized if the Bulls steal a game or two on the back of Noah.\r\n \r\nMcHale: Honestly, at this point, it feels like the Heat are beyond facing pressure on an individual basis. They''re eyeing a place in history ... not individual matchups.\r\n \r\nNowell: Dwyane Wade. If Wade is healthy, and is capable of playing like it, the Heat have a shot at a really special playoff run. That''s not to say they don''t if his knee problems are a severe limitation, but if Wade can play something close to pain-free, the Heat don''t have a serious challenge left in the field.\r\n \r\nWallace: Chris Bosh. This series will be physical, and that means Bosh must step outside of his comfort zone a bit and get dirty in the paint. He hasn''t had many great games against the Bulls, but now is as good a time as any to deliver a few. Or, he stands to be exposed by Joakim Noah and Carlos Boozer.', 'Who has the edge heading into Round 2? '),

I might have a chance," although coach Tom Thibodeau ruled him out for Game 1.\r\n\r\nAsked about Rose''s availability for the series, Thibodeau said "we''ll see."\r\n\r\nWith many of his teammates fighting through injuries and illness to play, former Bull and TNT analyst Steve Kerr said last week that Rose owed it to his team to play if he is healthy.

Right now, I''m not ready so I''m just trying to take my time and just really, really be smart."\r\n\r\nRose has been scrimmaging 5-on-5 since Feb. 18 and has been medically cleared to play for two months, but he still doesn''t feel confident that his body is ready for game action.\r\n\r\n"It''s definitely hard but I know that this will be over with pretty soon.

But after more than 10 days of rest and treatment, Wade said he expects to play Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heat are preparing for Rose, who hasn''t played at all this season after May 12 knee surgery, if he does return at some point during the series.\r\n\r\n"We have to prepare for the awareness that he could possibly come back," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Sunday. "That''s all the thought we''re giving it. If he does [return in the series], we''ll try to be as aggressive as we normally are."\r\n\r\nWith or without an appearance from Rose, the Heat are preparing for what''s expected to be a brutal series.\r\n\r\n"I''d be surprised," Heat center Chris Bosh said about the possibility of Rose returning. "But that''s totally his decision. If he does, we''re going to make it tough on him."\r\n\r\nDeng missed the past two games of the Bulls'' series against the Brooklyn Nets because of the flu and did not make the trip to Miami and it''s uncertain when he will rejoin the team. He was admitted back into the hospital on Sunday but has since been discharged, Thibodeau said.\r\n\r\n"He had a spinal tap so he''s been sick," Thibodeau said. "Still not feeling as well as he would like so he''s gone back to the hospital to get tested more, more treatment. I spoke to him this morning. He''s feeling a little better."\r\n\r\nThibodeau said the Bulls have "more than enough" to win even without Deng.\r\n\r\n"Lu''s been a very important part of the team, sort of the glue of our team," Thibodeau said. "With that being said, he''s missed games during the season and he missed games in the last series. We have more than enough to get it done and that''s what we have to do."\r\nAsked if he felt more pressure to play with Deng out a third straight game, Rose said: "No, it''s no pressure at all. I haven''t had any pressure from anyone. Not in the organization, not from my teammates. They know that I''m putting everything I have on trying to come back as fast as possible. But just trying to be smart with the whole situation and just take my time."\r\n\r\nDeng tweeted on Friday that he was taken to the emergency room Wednesday, and his symptoms indicated he might have had meningitis, requiring him to undergo a spinal tap.\r\n\r\n"As a result of the spinal tap I suffered the worst headache I''ve ever experienced and been the weakest I''ve ever felt," Deng tweeted.\r\n\r\nA source close to the situation said that Deng had to undergo a separate procedure in relation to the spinal tap procedure to stop leaking spinal fluid.\r\n\r\nHinrich will be a game-time decision with a bruised left calf.

(8, '2013-05-06 17:26:27', 'Basketball', 'images/image5.jpg', 'Charting the Lakers', '1. Fact or Fiction: The Lakers would''ve been contenders if healthy.\r\n\r\nLarry Coon, ESPN Insider: Either fact or fiction, depending on how you define "healthy." If Dwight Howard is completely healthy, then fact. But we didn''t see that Dwight all season. With a recovering Dwight, the Lakers team that finished the season strong still didn''t have enough to get past Oklahoma City or Miami. Kobe''s Achilles injury didn''t change their fortunes, it just sealed the deal.\r\n\r\nDanny Nowell, Portland Roundball Society: Fiction. Better, yes, but they were too old and too thin and too slow to contend with the murderer''s row at the top of the Western Conference. Health doesn''t take any years off Steve Nash or make Kobe expend any more defensive energy, and the bench was an eyesore even in top condition.\r\n\r\nChris Palmer, ESPN The Magazine: Absolutely fact. They would have realistically challenged for a spot in the Western Conference finals. That''s contending. Look, they had the fourth-best record in the NBA since the All-Star break. They just got hammered so badly by injuries you almost felt sorry for them. They rarely had any genuine continuity. Basketball observers everywhere were robbed of seeing what this kind of talent could really do together.\r\n\r\nDarius Soriano, Forum Blue And Gold: Fact. The Lakers were a top-heavy team and injuries cost them their top talent. And then, for good measure, they took away their backups, too. Those injuries also cost them the chance to build the chemistry and togetherness that contending teams need. Give the Lakers good health, and their chances for success increase exponentially.\r\n\r\nMarc Stein, ESPN.com: This is one of those faction situations. Can you define "healthy" for me? If healthy means that Nash and Pau never missed any time â€¦ that Dwight made an even faster recovery from back surgery than he did â€¦ and that Kobe never tore his Achilles â€¦ I''m still gullible enough to say maybe.\r\n\r\n2. Fact or Fiction: Dwight Howard should stay with the Lakers.\r\n\r\nCoon: Another one that could be either fact or fiction, this time depending on how you define "should." The Lakers'' roster is somewhat of a mess right now. What''s Dwight looking for as he picks his next team? If he''s looking to be the centerpiece of the next generation of a premier NBA franchise, then he should stay in L.A. If he wants the best chance to win the title in 2014, then the Lakers have a lot of question marks, and maybe he should look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNowell: Fiction. Howard''s reputation would be best served by jump-starting an image rehab and staying with the Lakers. But I think he is unlikely to thrive under L.A.''s glare, with a dominant franchise personality and a coach with a fairly fixed system. Dwight leaving will heap yet more scorn on him, but he needs a new start â€¦ again.\r\n\r\nPalmer: Fact. Howard can make $118 million with the Lakers or $88 million elsewhere. So there''s that. This season his rep was damaged by subpar health, confusion about his role and a total lack of leadership skills. He''s got to atone for that without changing jerseys. He just can''t continue to run from a less-than-perfect situation every time things start to go awry. Dwight, show us you can lead. And fulfill your potential. You can build an actual legacy in Los Angeles, and the town can be yours. Man up.\r\n\r\nSoriano: Fact. The Lakers can offer Dwight the most money, a fantastic market, and the chance to be the face of a franchise with nearly unparalleled success in the history of the league. No other organization can offer him even two of those three things.\r\n\r\nStein: Fact. But I say it with no conviction. I''m really not so sure. I think he''d be happier and more productive in Houston or Dallas. Not exactly a ringing endorsement about the Dwight fit in Lakerland when the best reason I can come up with for him staying is that he''d unavoidably take another massive PR hit if he walked away from this car crash at the first opportunity.', 'The Los Angeles Lakers'' season ended with a merciful thud on Sunday night, as the Kobe-less Lakers decimated by injuries ended up on the wrong end of a sweep at the hands of the San Antonio Spurs.

(9, '2013-05-06 17:27:36', 'Soccer', 'images/image6.jpg', 'Team of the Week', 'Maybe Reading might still be in with a shout of Premier League survival had they taken the handbrake off earlier in the campaign. Nigel Adkins threw the doors wide open for the visit of Fulham, and they registered four goals in only their second away win of the season, but that did mean a busy afternoon for Alex McCarthy. Of the seven saves he made, two stood out, from Bryan Ruiz and Hugo Rodallega.\r\n\r\nNewcastle United looked a far more solid unit at West Ham with captain Fabricio Coloccini back in the fold. After the horror show of last week, when they conceded a cool half dozen against Liverpool, Alan Pardew was forced to bat away claims of disharmony in the camp. The return of the frizzy-haired Argentinean eased the pressure slightly as his leadership and shackling of old boy Andy Carroll earned only their second clean sheet since January 12.\r\n\r\nDefences were most definitely on top at Anfield, so perhaps it is no surprise two centre-halves have barged their way into TOTW. It was a particularly poignant encounter for Jamie Carragher, who is set to hang up his boots at the end of the season, and though he didn''t get the win he was desperate for, a clean sheet will surely have satisfied him on his final Merseyside derby appearance. The 35-year-old battled all afternoon with the likes of Victor Anichebe and Marouane Fellaini to register another shut out.\r\n\r\nAt the other end Sylvain Distin was magnificent alongside the equally impressive Phil Jagielka. Whenever Liverpool did manage to fashion an opportunity, one of the two Toffees was on hand to snuff out the danger. Distin kept Daniel Sturridge quiet for most of the afternoon and took up a fine position after Steven Gerrard had dashed round Tim Howard in order to block the Liverpool captain''s shot on the line.\r\n\r\nChelsea''s pivotal win at Old Trafford was secured thanks to another virtuoso performance from Juan Mata. The Spaniard''s strike was corrected after the game to a Phil Jones own goal but it was his run and shot that set up the decisive moment in a largely forgettable match. Prior to that Mata had been the spark for virtually all of Chelsea''s attacking forays, probing intelligently behind Demba Ba. A total of 18 goals and 26 assists across all competitions this season speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nShould Wigan pull off yet another great escape it will owe much to the enduring form of diminutive winger Shaun Maloney, who, like his club, seems to excel in the spring months. Wigan twice trailed at West Brom but locked down a crucial win thanks to three decisive interventions by Maloney. After an involvement in Wigan''s first, after which he was clattered, he then delivered a devilish cross for James McArthur to equalise then danced to byline to set up the winner for Callum McManaman.\r\n\r\nAfter a week in which pretty much every football award going was presented at his feet, Gareth Bale reminded everyone why he is the PFA Player of the Year. Up against the club that honed his talent, Southampton, Bale had been largely anonymous for most of the game. But that''s the thing about great players - they are capable of changing any game in an instant. And so it proved in the 86th minute as Bale cut inside Luke Shaw to lash a low shot into the net and secure a precious three points.\r\n\r\n"I know I would''ve got the hat-trick," Hal Robson-Kanu tweeted after he was substituted with eight minutes left at Craven Cottage. He may well be right too, after giving Fulham a torrid time during Reading''s 4-2 win. The Welsh winger won and scored an early penalty to set his team off and running, then converted a fine second, slamming a loose ball into the far corner beyond Mark Schwarzer. By his reckoning, that is seven goals from 11 starts this season. Not bad at all.\r\n\r\nIf Fulham had a hard time getting to grips with Robson-Kanu then the thorn in Reading''s side was Bryan Ruiz. The Costa Rican did his level best to keep Fulham in with a chance of the point or points that would have secured Premier League survival for another year, with a pair of well taken goals, one slotted home with his right after an interchange with Hugo Rodallega, the other a neat header from Alexander Kacaniklic''s cross.\r\n\r\nAston Villa''s sparkling end-of-season form has had much to do with Gabriel Agbonlahor, a vital cog in the wheel who has often been overshadowed by the barnstorming brilliance of Christian Benteke. But the Brummy seized centre stage on Saturday with a devastating display at Carrow Road. Both his goals were expertly taken, the first a product of his own creation, as he surged into Norwich''s half before finishing from 25 yards. And after the Canaries had levelled, Agbonlahor struck the decisive blow, latching on to Ashley Westwood''s sublime pass to lift Villa to the 40-point mark.\r\n\r\nIn a disappointed clash at Loftus Road, Theo Walcott provided the undoubted highlight within 20 seconds of the opening whistle. Finding space inside the area, Walcott accepted an astute pass from Mikel Arteta to finish past Rob Green. He continued to provide the game''s biggest threat, hitting the base of the post shortly after his goal and testing Green several more times in the second half as Arsenal grabbed a vital win in their fight for Champions League football.\r\n\r\nThere are two outstanding candidates for manager of the week this time around and after plenty of pondering in the office we have decided they can''t be split. So for perhaps the first time in TOTW history, we''ll be taking a hacksaw to the award and chopping it in half. Rafael Benitez has this week not only guided his team to a vital win against champions Manchester United at old Trafford, but also into the Europa League final. And while Paul Lambert might be fighting at the opposite end of the table, he also deserves recognition after two wins in a week â€“ including one on his old stomping ground - that have transported Aston Villa a long way towards Premier League safety. Enjoy it gentlemen.', 'Top team of the week'),
(10, '2013-05-06 17:28:28', 'Soccer', 'images/image7.jpg', ' Mata inspires and enhances Rafa', 'In the interim before the Special One''s return, the Snubbed One is almost rehabilitated. While Jose Mourinho has long delighted in deriding Rafa Benitez, he may be the beneficiary of his hard work if he returns to Stamford Bridge. His arch-enemy''s legacy could be Champions League football. His probable successor should be grateful, even if, typically, the Spaniard celebrated by the Chelsea support was Juan Mata, not Benitez.\r\n\r\nIgnored by the fans, the unappreciated caretaker nonetheless secured his greatest victory in league football since he left Liverpool. Mata''s late winner - later credited as a Phil Jones own goal - enabled Benitez to defeat another of his critics, Sir Alex Ferguson, and position Chelsea to effectively ensure a top-four finish when they face Tottenham on Wednesday. "We are in the driving seat," Benitez said. "We can win and be there." The most demanding of jobs, with a backdrop of hostility and despite the most gruelling of workloads, is near completion. Benitez will not be feted, but he may be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFerguson had sniped that Benitez is overly concerned about his CV. Lacking the Old Trafford dictator''s job security, he may be but it is improving, along with his record in their private duels. Benitez is unbeaten in three meetings since he returned from his unwanted sabbatical. Including Roberto Di Matteo''s reign, Chelsea have defeated Manchester United in three competitions this season, even if Ferguson''s charges secured the victory that mattered most to them, 3-2 in October''s league game.\r\n\r\nUnlike Liverpool''s 4-1 demolition of United in 2009, Benitez''s latest triumph will not live long in the memory. It was not a clinical dissection of title rivals, but three points pilfered against a side deprived of purpose after clinching the league. The decider, Ferguson complained, was "a lucky goal", albeit one that followed delightful build-up when Ramires backheeled to Oscar, who picked out Mata. His scuffed shot took a telling deflection off Jones. Even the stylist can savour a scrappy goal, however, especially when it is as significant.\r\n\r\n"He could be player of the year for everything he did for us," said Benitez. Until the Premier League rebranded it an own goal, it was Mata''s 19th of the season. Yet its timing was symbolic: Chelsea scored late on in their 65th game of an epic season. The more games they play, the stronger they seem to get.\r\n\r\nAnd yet if hostilities have thawed a little between the warring managers, who are prepared to share a handshake if not a drink, there is no entente cordiale between United and Chelsea. Rafael da Silva''s season ended early, one Brazilian dismissed for a hack at another. Ferguson, however, felt the blame lay with David Luiz for first provoking his right-back and then writhing on the ground.\r\n\r\n"It was quite clear Luiz has elbowed him twice," he argued. "The referee hasn''t even seen it at all. He has gone with the fact Luiz has rolled around on the floor and that has convinced him it is a red card."\r\n\r\nIf Ferguson, whose moans incorporated the suggestion referee Howard Webb gave Chelsea every decision, appeared a graceless loser, he was nonetheless willing to admit the visitors were deserving winners. They joined Tottenham and Manchester City in winning at Old Trafford this season, even if they were aided by Ferguson''s team selection.\r\n\r\nIt was a day to suggest his squad is not quite as strong as he imagines. For three-quarters of the match, United were minus Wayne Rooney although, unless Paris Saint-Germain are also intent on buying the rested trio of David de Gea, Michael Carrick and Rio Ferdinand, less should be read into this than the last marquee match he watched from the bench. Without him, however, Robin van Persie was deprived of sufficient support in attack; his only clear-cut chance came from an incisive pass from Ryan Giggs.\r\n\r\nAnderson and Tom Cleverley, two men who can operate in Carrick''s slipstream, were rudderless without the leader of the midfield. The Brazilian has more personality, the Englishman the merit of youth but neither is cementing a place. Indeed, twin understudies departed together as contrasting replacements, Rooney and Alexander Buttner, entered proceedings.\r\n\r\nCleverley had a series of shots that lacked accuracy, Jones, the galloping gurner, a number of crosses that ranged from the reasonable to the wayward. Anders Lindegaard, standing in for De Gea, was fortunate not to concede when he unconvincingly pushed Oscar''s shot on to the post.\r\n  At the other end, United failed to score in home league match for first time since December 2009 when Gabriel Agbonlahor fired Martin O''Neill''s Aston Villa to victory. As Chelsea kept a clean sheet, Benitez was justified in sidelining the club captain for a second successive game.\r\n\r\n"Where''s your favourite centre-half," the Stretford End inquired innocently as a bibbed John Terry warmed up in front of them. Schadenfreude is their default reaction whenever he falls from grace. They enjoy Benitez''s mishaps, too, but there was nothing for his tormentors to savour. Ridiculed and written off, Benitez has almost completed his mission.\r\n\r\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Juan Mata - Overlooked with the focus on Van Persie, Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale, he has had a fabulous season. Even before forcing the winner, he was Chelsea''s most creative player, drifting intelligently into the inside-right channel to find space.\r\n\r\nMANCHESTER UNITED VERDICT: Few of Ferguson''s squad players enhanced their reputations and there was a huge cheer when Rooney was belatedly introduced. Much of their crossing, in particular, was poor and the only invention and incision in the midfield came from a 39-year-old in his 939th game, in the shape of Giggs. Wilfried Zaha will be an interesting addition in the summer, not least because United''s wingers have underachieved this season.\r\n\r\nCHELSEA VERDICT: While a stalemate long looked likely, they were the more determined and the more positive side. Chelsea''s progress is remarkable given the lack of prolific striker: indeed they have only had two league goals from specialist forwards in 2013. Frank Lampard, looking for No. 202 of his Chelsea career in all competitions, will have to wait another game to draw level with Bobby Tambling although, as ever, he kept trying his luck.', 'While Jose Mourinho has long delighted in deriding Rafa Benitez, he may be the beneficiary of his hard work if he returns to Stamford Bridge.'),

Crystal Palace''s match with Peterborough United was the league in microcosm, with the fine lines between success and failure starkly apparent.\r\n\r\nIn the end top overcame bottom and there was relief and despair in equal measure, with Palace closing out a 3-2 win to secure their play-off place and Peterborough relegated by events in the final ten minutes. It was against current form, with Palace winless in nine and Peterborough arriving with just one loss in twelve.\r\n\r\nThis was just the tip of the iceberg in overall terms, for the day and for the season, with Watford coming tantalisingly close to stealing the second automatic promotion spot from Hull, and five different teams occupying the play-off spots in 3rd and 6th place before Gianfranco Zola''s side and a joyous Leicester ended up in them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom saw similar turnover, with Barnsley starting off in third-bottom (the final relegation spot) and Peterborough, Huddersfield, Barnsley again and finally Posh occupying it at various stages. It has been some scrap at the foot of the table. Even second-bottom Wolves, who succumbed to defeat at in-form Brighton and were never really in the final day shake-up, finished with a total of 51 points, which would have seen them safe in each of the last four seasons.\r\n\r\nThe drama in Palace''s camp was rather of their own making. Having been top of the Championship in October and strong automatic promotion candidates throughout, their poor run just at the wrong time had left them sweating. It was no coincidence that 29-goal top scorer Glenn Murray has failed to score in eight coming into the game with Peterborough.\r\n\r\nAs far as that coveted top spot is concerned, the suspense has been over for almost as long as Palace have been parted from it. Cardiff City â€“ at the end of a season that began in tumult, as the Bluebirds were turned red by Malaysian owner Vincent Tan to wide local disapproval â€“ hit the summit for the third and final time 18 games in and rarely looked like relinquishing their throne. The champions join near neighbours Swansea City to form a South Wales axis in the Premier League next season, which will excite fans as much as it will send a shudder down the spine of the region''s police force.\r\n\r\nFar from winding down on the final day with the trophy, Malky Mackay''s side almost managed to scupper Hull''s promotion challenge. They took the lead at the KC Stadium with a goal from former Tigers forward Fraizer Campbell at the dawn of the second half. Combined with Ahmen Abdi''s equaliser for Watford against Leeds - while all the rest of the Championship were enjoying a well-deserved half-time cuppa, due to a delay caused to a bad-looking injury to Watford goalkeeper Jonathan Bond â€“ Hull dropped into third place behind Zola''s side.\r\n\r\nSteve Bruce''s men turned it around, but only just. Nick Proschwitz, disappointing since his Â£2 million signing from Bundesliga. 2 side Paderborn, had stepped up to be an unlikely hero with an equaliser, and when Paul McShane gave the Tigers the lead, they seemed home and hosed. Yet Proschwitz missed a stoppage-time penalty to seal the deal before Nicky Maynard made it 2-2 with a spot-kick for the visitors.\r\n\r\nThe Tigers had themselves to blame that it had got this far, having taken just one point from three previous games â€“ incidentally, against the bottom three â€“ when a win would have clinched things. It all meant that if Watford could find a winner in their held-up game they â€“ and not Hull â€“ would avoid the play-offs and go straight up. Bruce and his players endured an agonising 13-minute wait, watching Watford''s progress on monitors in the players'' tunnel, before Ross McCormack''s breakaway goal for Leeds confirmed Hull''s ascent.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens from here, Watford have been one of the stories of the season. There has been much suspicion of and opposition to the loan-player-heavy methods of their owners, the Pozzo family, but it has produced some breathtaking football at no financial risk. Who''d have thought there would be another way to success other than chucking a load of money at the puzzle, eh?\r\n\r\nHull have been there and done that before, most notoriously when midfielder Jimmy Bullard was given a reported four-year, Â£50,000-per week deal in a vain attempt to keep the Tigers in the Premier League in 2009 - only for an old knee injury to resurface twenty minutes into his debut. Owner Assem Allam has done much to put the club on a more even financial keel and has his reward for putting his faith in Bruce, overlooked by Wolves last season â€“ one suspects, to the Molineux club''s lasting regret.\r\n\r\nWolves'' chosen appointments were a big factor behind a second successive demotion, with Stale Solbakken fading badly after a good start and his replacement Dean Saunders not a universally popular one. Still, they looked to have averted the worst with a run of five wins from six matches before a fatal dip in the final weeks. They were almost followed by the freefalling Blackburn Rovers, a club whose laughably incompetent ownership''s running of the club makes the Wolves board look like Bayern Munich''s. Eventually the goals of Â£8 million Jordan Rhodes made the difference and offered hope for a more stable future.\r\n\r\nThe real plaudits at the bottom go to Barnsley''s David Flitcroft. After taking charge of his first manager''s post at the end of December, the 39-year-old has transformed the team. Had they posted the 1.68 points-per-game average achieved under Flitcroft for the entire season, Barnsley would have gone into the final day with a chance of automatic promotion.\r\n\r\nDue to the excellent form of a number of their rivals, the Tykes started the day in that dreaded 22nd place, and after taking the lead twice in their basement battle with Huddersfield, twice fell back into after conceding equalisers.\r\n\r\nThey were saved by Peterborough''s shortcomings. Cheered on by a large away following, the Posh were impressive in south London and led twice through superb strikes by Lee Tomlin and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing. Darren Ferguson''s side were undone by late strikes by the indefatigable Kevin Phillips and Mile Jedinak, but led his players over to the visiting fans at the final whistle, where they deservedly received generous applause.\r\n\r\nThe drama''s not over yet. Palace will relish their play-off semi-final pairing with their bitter rivals Brighton, while Watford will attempt to pick themselves up to play Leicester. This season that keeps giving has a little more in the tank.', 'Crystal Palace''s match with Peterborough United was the league in microcosm, with the fine lines between success and failure starkly apparent.'),

Especially if you''re not at the ballpark and you can set up a laptop outside, put up your feet, soak in those first warm rays of early May and imagine what it''s like to throw a baseball like these two guys. \r\n \r\nDarvish faced the Red Sox and struck out 14 batters in his seven innings -- and in some ways this was a bad start for him, as he gave up two home runs and three runs. But he showed why he''s been so tough this season: four strikeouts on his fastball, six with his slider, three on his curve and a 14th on a pitch classified as a splitter (a 93-mph pitch that David Ortiz swung through in the sixth inning). Who knows; it could have been a gyroball or some other exotic pitch Darvish made up on the spot. On his 127th and final pitch, he fanned Pedro Ciriaco on a 3-2 slider that moved wickedly away from the plate. Rangers manager Ron Washington took him out, and he ended up with a no-decision in Texas'' 4-3 victory, but I have no doubt he could have pitched another inning or two. \r\n \r\nVerlander, meanwhile, cruised through the Triple-A lineup known as the Houston Astros, taking a no-hitter into the seventh while rarely pumping up the velocity on his fastball. He didn''t need to. He averaged 92.8 mph on his heater, but on this day that was enough. He pitched seven scoreless frames, allowing two hits and striking out nine. \r\n \r\nWith apologies to Clay Buchholz (great start but inconsistent career), Matt Harvey (too soon), Jordan Zimmermann (getting there), Adam Wainwright (amazing control so far) and a few others, the battle for best right-handed starter in baseball right now is between Darvish, Verlander and Felix Hernandez, who pitched his own must-watch gem on Friday, shutting out the Toronto Blue Jays over eight innings. \r\n \r\nLet''s take a quick look at how the three have fared in 2013. \r\n \r\nThe statistics \r\nDarvish: 5-1, 2.56 ERA, 45.2 IP, 27 H, 15 BB, 72 SO, 3 HR, .169 AVG \r\nVerlander: 4-2, 1.55 ERA, 46.1 IP, 38 H, 13 BB, 50 SO, 1 HR, .222 AVG \r\nHernandez: 4-2, 1.60 ERA, 50.2 IP, 39 H, 7 BB, 51 SO, 3 HR, .212 AVG \r\n \r\nHernandez has pitched the most innings; Verlander and Hernandez have the lower ERAs; but Darvish has been the most dominant, averaging 14.1 strikeouts per nine innings, a mark that would shatter Randy Johnson''s record for starters of 13.4, set in 2001. Darvish has also been the toughest to hit with that .169 batting average against and has to pitch in the best hitter''s park of the three. Hernandez, however, has faced a slightly tougher slate of offenses, mostly because he''s had to pitch against the Rangers and Tigers while the other two haven''t. All three started once against Houston ... and none allowed a run. \r\n \r\nEdge: We can''t put too much emphasis on ERA this early in the season. Hernandez has the edge in durability and command, but Darvish''s strikeout rate has been off-the-charts phenomenal. Edge to Darvish. \r\n \r\nIssues entering the season \r\nDarvish: Command, especially of fastball; he must prove he can be a 200-inning workhorse (threw 191.1 in 29 starts last season). \r\n \r\nSo far, it''s mixed reviews on this. His walk rate is down from 11.9 percent to 8.4 percent, so that''s good. His percentage of fastballs in the strike zone, however, is actually just 42 percent, down 10 percent from last season. He has the killer wipeout pitches when he gets to two strikes -- 20 K''s in 31 plate appearances ending with his curve, 29 K''s in 69 plate appearances with his slider -- which makes it scary that he''s been so good without consistently throwing his fastball for strikes. In part, this works to his advantage -- kind of an effective wildness that makes it hard for hitters to attack his fastball (or his cutter, which hasn''t been a great pitch for him) but can lead to some high pitch counts and fewer innings.\r\n \r\nVerlander: Durability after leading AL in innings the past two seasons and throwing 50 more in the postseason. Would there be a letdown after two great seasons? \r\n \r\nI''d say a 1.55 ERA answers the second question. He hasn''t pitched more than seven innings yet, which is unusual for him, but that''s not just because of a tight leash. He''s had games of 126, 116, 114, 111 and 111 pitches. He did throw 120-plus in nine regular-season starts in 2012, so Jim Leyland has maybe been a little conservative so far, but Verlander has also pitched in a lot of cold weather. Plus, Leyland may hold back a bit, trying to make sure Verlander remains stronger for a possible October run. \r\n \r\nHernandez: Concerns about declining fastball velocity and late slump last season (0-4, 6.62 ERA in six September starts). \r\n \r\nSo far, his average fastball is down one mph from last season (92.1 to 91.1), which, in turn, is down two mph from 2011 and down from the 93.9 he averaged in his 2010 Cy Young season. Put it this way: His fastest fastball this season was 94.1 -- pretty much his average just three seasons ago. That said, he''s been as good as ever, thanks to that Wiffleball changeup and showing that whatever happened last September was an aberration. \r\n \r\nEdge: Even though he doesn''t throw as hard as he once did, Hernandez looks better than ever with one of the best stretches of his career. Sure, it helps pitching in the dead air of the West Coast ballparks, and maybe some day the lack of separation betweeen his fastball and changeup will catch up to him, but we''re not there yet. \r\n \r\nStuff \r\nDarvish: Off the charts. He is basically unhittable when he gets to two strikes, thanks to that curveball/slider combo. In 112 plate appearances with two strikes, batters are hitting .088 with 72 strikeouts, eight walks and two extra-base hits. Ouch. \r\n \r\nVerlander: Speaking of fastball velocity, Verlander has yet to unleash one of his famous 100-mph heaters and has averaged just 92.2 mph with a peak velocity of 97.1. That doesn''t mean it''s been any easier to hit: Batters are hitting .192/.289/.256 against his fastball, which is actually worse than the .215/.291/.362 line in 2011. \r\n \r\nHernandez: There might not be a better pitch in the game right now than Hernandez''s changeup, which moves away from lefties and jams righties. Batters are hitting .130 off it. He mixes in some sliders and curveballs, making him a four-pitch guy with great command of all four pitches. \r\n \r\nEdge: It''s hard to suggest somebody has better stuff than Verlander, but right now that''s the case with Darvish''s deep arsenal of weapons. Verlander doesn''t necessarily have to crank it up 95-plus regularly -- we know that he''s learned to conserve that until he needs it -- but until he does start doing that more often, nobody can match the electric arsenal of pitches that Darvish possesses. \r\n \r\nWho is the best? \r\nThis is like picking between Mays and Mantle at their peaks. There''s only one way to answer: If all three are pitching at the same time and you can watch only one -- and you don''t have a rooting interest in one of the specific teams -- who are you watching? Right now, I''m watching Darvish. Put him in a neutral park and I think he''s the best right-hander in the game. \r\n \r\nBut I might change my mind next week. \r\n \r\nREST OF THE WEEKEND \r\n \r\nThree stars \r\n1. Marcell Ozuna, Marlins. A controversial call-up earlier in the week, considering he''d played just 10 games in Double-A (although he hit five home runs), Ozuna didn''t look overmatched his first week in the majors, hitting .478 with five extra-base hits in his first six games. He hit his first home run off Cole Hamels in Saturday''s 2-0 win -- a nice easy swing off a 92-mph fastball -- and then went 4-for-5 with two doubles, three runs and three RBIs on Sunday. \r\n \r\n2. Jeremy Guthrie, Royals. Guthrie''s three-year, $25 million free agent deal with Kansas City was widely panned, but so far, so great. Guthrie threw a four-hit shutout in Saturday''s 2-0 win over the White Sox -- yes, a manager who let a pitcher go the distance in a close game! -- and improved to 4-0 with a 2.40 ERA. \r\n \r\n3. Jon Jay, Cardinals. A few days ago, Jay was hitting .204 and he''d lost his leadoff spot in the lineup. Now he''s had four straight two-hit games and is batting a respectable .252/.339/.393. He drove in two runs on Friday, hit a three-run homer off Yovani Gallardo on Saturday and scored two more runs on Sunday. The Cardinals won all four in Milwaukee. \r\n \r\nClutch performance of the weekend \r\nRangers pitching staff. The Red Sox entered the weekend leading the AL in on-base percentage, slugging percentage and wOBA (weighted on-base average) -- in other words, the best offense in the league. Derek Holland, Alexi Ogando and Darvish held the Red Sox to four runs in 21 innings, striking out 27, as the Rangers swept. That''s an impressive three starts against any lineup, but especially against a red-hot lineup in a pitcher''s park like Texas''. The Rangers moved into a tie with the Red Sox for the best record in the AL, and it''s been all about their pitching -- they''ve allowed the fewest runs in the AL. Kudos once again to pitching coach Mike Maddux for building a staff that appeared to have some holes entering the season (and especially when Matt Harrison underwent back surgery). \r\n \r\nBest game \r\nGiants 10, Dodgers 9, 10 innings (Saturday). On Friday night, Buster Posey hit a walk-off home run off Ronald Belisario on a 3-2 fastball to give the Giants a 2-1 win. On Saturday night, it was an unlikely hero for the Giants: Backup catcher Guillermo Quiroz lined a pinch-hit homer on an 0-2 pitch from Brandon League to give the Giants a 10-9 victory. The crazy game included the Giants blowing 5-0 and 6-1 leads, the Dodgers scoring seven runs in the fifth inning, the Giants tying it up, the Dodgers turning a 4-3 double play on Posey with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth and then Quiroz hitting that sinker from League just over the fence in left for his third career home run and first against a right-hander. It wasn''t a terrible pitch from League, as you can see from the pitch location map below; sometimes, the hitter just gets good wood on a good pitch.  of the fan bloggers on the SweetSpot Blog Network.

But he said that after that, the soreness "just kind of progressed over the last two weeks or so."\r\n\r\nIn his two starts since then, Halladay has allowed 17 earned runs in only six innings. He gave up eight runs in 3 2/3 innings in Cleveland on Tuesday, then was rocked for nine runs on just four hits Sunday. He walked four of the 17 hitters he faced and hit two others.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, he joined CC Sabathia as the only former Cy Young Award winner to allow eight-plus earned runs in back-to-back starts.

Swept by the Giants, including two on walk-off home runs. Hanley Ramirez, just activated from the DL earlier in the weekend, landed back on it after straining a hamstring on Friday. Adrian Gonzalez didn''t start any of the three games because of a stiff neck but pinch-hit on Sunday, so I guess his neck was OK for one at-bat but not four. Meanwhile, Matt Kemp is still sitting on one home run, they''ve already used nine starting pitchers (rookie Matt Magill couldn''t get out of the second inning on Saturday) and Sunday''s lineup included Nick Punto, Juan Uribe, Luis Cruz and Dee Gordon. You''re not winning anything with that group. Heck, Clayton Kershaw may ask for a trade not a contract extension. As for Sunday''s game, Matt Cain took a 4-0 lead into the eighth before tiring and walking Kemp and Uribe (who has suddenly developed the plate discipline of Ted Williams). The Giants'' bullpen allowed all three of Cain''s runners to score before finally closing the door on the 4-3 win. I''d say Cain finally looked like vintage Cain but, again, it wasn''t much of a lineup he faced. The Dodgers are 13-17, they''re second-to-last in runs scored in the National League, they''re minus-27 in run differential and their best player isn''t hitting. Right now, they''re a bad baseball team, and showing no signs they have the talent to dig out of this.\r\n  \r\nThe Orioles beat the Angels 8-4 to take three out of four in Anaheim. Manny Machado continues to impress with the bat almost as much as he has impressed in the field, hitting his fifth home run and improving his batting line to .309/.352/.522. The Orioles finished 7-4 on their longest road trip of the season and have won five of their past six series. How loaded is third base in the American League? You have Miguel Cabrera, Adrian Beltre and Evan Longoria, and now Machado, the underrated Kyle Seager in Seattle and Josh Donaldson, off to a good start with the A''s.\r\n  \r\nSpeaking of Donaldson, his home run off Boone Logan in the eighth was the decisive run in Oakland''s 5-4 win over the Yankees. The key decision, however, came in the bottom of the ninth when Brett Gardner singled with two outs off Grant Balfour and with Robinson Cano up was wild pitched to second. Bob Melvin elected to walk Cano -- the potential winning run -- a risky move and one that looked good when Vernon Wells struck out. Essentially, Melvin increased his chances of winning (Wells more likely to make an out than Cano) while simultaneously increasing his chances of losing (by putting the go-ahead on base). What he did was decrease the chance of a tie (because of the lesser chance of a game-tying hit). Interesting decision but not one you see too often.\r\n \r\nBryce Harper got ejected, the second ejection of his career. Seems like umpire John Hirshbeck got the check-swing call correct (the pitch was probably a strike anyway), but it certainly appears like he got a little itchy with the trigger finger. Come on, umps, the game isn''t about you.\r\n  \r\nNice win for the Royals over the White Sox. Billy Butler tied it in the bottom of the ninth with a two-run double with two outs and then they won it in the 10th. The Tigers beat up on the hapless Astros this weekend but the Royals stayed a half-game behind and have won four in a row. They can sweep the White Sox in Monday''s makeup game. I still don''t know what to make of the Royals. The pitching has been terrific but Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Salvador Perez and Jeff Francoeur have combined for three home runs. The optimist says that even when the pitching inevitably regresses the offense will start picking up the slack.

(19, '2013-05-06 17:33:23', 'Hockey', 'images/image14.jpg', 'Toronto is buzzing for the Leaf', 'TORONTO -- Nine years and two days. \r\n\r\nThat''s how long it''s been since Air Canada Centre hosted an NHL playoff game. \r\nBut heck, who''s counting? \r\n\r\nProving just how loyal the NHL''s largest fan base is, the incredible buzz leading up to the Maple Leafs'' Monday home playoff date with the Boston Bruins is inescapable in these parts. All is apparently forgiven for the nine springs in which this building went dark. \r\n\r\n"Being back in the playoffs is amazing and has re-energized our fans, our organization and the whole city," Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment president Tom Anselmi told ESPN.com on Monday morning. \r\n\r\n"That intensity was dialed up another notch after Saturday''s win, so the anticipation for tonight''s game has the city bursting at the seams. Air Canada Centre and Maple Leaf Square will be rocking. Flags flying, horns honking, a playoff spring in Toronto is here, and I''m so proud of our players and so happy for our fans." \r\n\r\nHe''s not kidding when he says horns are honking and flags are flying. I was back in town for just a few hours Monday morning and couldn''t miss the unmistakable buzz. This city is ready to party. \r\n\r\n"Itâ€™s going to be a loud and rowdy atmosphere, but it won''t be as special if we don''t go out and play the way weâ€™re capable of," star Leafs winger Joffrey Lupul said after morning skate Monday in a home dressing room packed to the gills with media. \r\n\r\nToronto is a city in need of something to cheer for. The NBA''s Raptors have become a complete afterthought in this town after yet another mediocre, non-playoff season. \r\n\r\nMLB''s Blue Jays had fans downright giddy in the lead-up to this young season thanks to a busy offseason that saw a number of aggressive moves make the team one of the early favorites, fueling hopes of a division title. Alas, April was a disaster, the ballclub unraveling quicker than a cheap suit. \r\n\r\nToronto FC of the MLS hasn''t done anything, really, ever. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the CFL''s Argonauts are the reigning Grey Cup champions, but although the CFL remains strong in most of the country, it just doesn''t have much of a pulse in Canadaâ€™s largest city. \r\n\r\nSo yes, the Leafs making the playoffs and getting a road split in Boston against the favored Bruins certainly has this city rocking. \r\n\r\n"The city''s obviously extremely excited," Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf said after the skate. \r\n\r\n"We''ve got the best fans in the National Hockey League, we''ve got an unbelievable following not just in Toronto but throughout the league. It''s obviously amped up in the playoffs. It''s an exciting time for us as players and an exciting time for the city. But as players, we''ve done a good job of keeping things inside the room." \r\n\r\nThe reality is, no other team in this city comes close to mattering as much as the Original Six club. \r\n\r\nThis is a Leafs town. Not so much a hockey town, but a Leafs town. \r\n\r\nDon''t even try to imagine what would happen here if the Leafs knocked out the Bruins in the first round. They might hear the car horns blaring all the way in Buffalo. \r\n\r\nLet''s not discount what this means financially to MLSE, either. It''s believed the Leafs will net between $1.5 million and $2 million in profit per game this spring. I repeat: per game. \r\n\r\nOf course, that''s good news for the 700-odd players across the league, too, since they get a 50 percent cut of hockey-related revenue per the CBA. "Go Leafs Go" should be the NHLPA''s Twitter handle during the playoffs. \r\n\r\nBut forget the money and get back to the hockey. The NHL playoffs are better with the Toronto Maple Leafs part of the mix. \r\n\r\nEven a die-hard Senators fan who professes to hate absolutely everything about the Leafs told ESPN.com before Sundayâ€™s game in Ottawa, "It''s more fun with the Leafs in it. I still want them to lose, but the playoffs are better when they make it." \r\n\r\nThe long wait ends Monday night around 7:15 p.m. ET. It''s going to be electric.

The bad blood between the two rivals escalated yet again, especially between the two head coaches. \r\n \r\n"We got beat by a good team tonight; they played very well," Montreal head coach Michel Therrien began in his postgame address. "I always believe you let the players dictate the game. Calling a timeout at 17 seconds in the game -- I never saw that before. \r\n \r\n"You never want to humiliate another team as a coach, and this is exactly what happened tonight. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, it was classless." \r\n \r\nSenators head coach Paul MacLean did indeed call a timeout late in the game with his team up 6-1, but he offered up an explanation for it. Just not sure the Habs will buy it. \r\n \r\n"I didnâ€™t know what was going to happen next," MacLean said. "I feel bad for the referees, but they wouldnâ€™t let me bring my players back to the bench so I can tell them what I wanted them to do. So my only recourse was to take the timeout because I didnâ€™t want anyone to get hurt. It was already getting dumb enough as it was. \r\n \r\n"So in order to protect my players under circumstances that were instigated by the Montreal Canadiens, I was forced to protect my players. And I will do that every time." \r\n \r\nAs far as Therrienâ€™s assertion that Maclean was trying to humiliate the Canadiens: "I thought they were doing a real good job of that themselves. They didnâ€™t need my help at all," MacLean fired back. \r\n \r\nDid someone turn back the clock and drop this series into 1984, featuring the Nordiques and Canadiens? \r\n \r\nMercy. \r\n \r\nAll of this, of course, was a byproduct of the controversial hit that Eric Gryba laid on Lars Eller in Game 1, which netted the Senators defenseman a two-game suspension but also ignited a verbal barrage from each side. \r\n \r\n"Michel talks about discipline and his team that really turned it around this year," Senators GM Bryan Murray told ESPN.com after the game Sunday night. "He took a shot at Paul, who was sticking up for his player recognizing that [Raphael] Diaz did make the pass that got Eller hurt. We donâ€™t like seeing players get hurt. We sure didnâ€™t want Eller [to] get hit the way he did, but thatâ€™s the game. Gryba stood up. I told Brendan Shanahan it was the wrong decision on his part. Iâ€™ve watched it 100 times. Iâ€™ve talked to hockey people around the league, and most of them, like 90 percent, agree it was shoulder to shoulder and then it slid across. So we didnâ€™t think it was the right thing. And we heard all the commentary from [Brandon] Prust and from Michel. Prust had a chance with [Chris] Neil and [Matt] Kassian on the ice and didnâ€™t do anything about it. When they left the ice, he stepped in and took a couple of cheap penalties. People shot pucks at people. I really object at that." \r\n \r\nMontreal defenseman Josh Gorges shot a puck toward Ottawaâ€™s Kyle Turris at the buzzer, which the Sens didnâ€™t like. \r\n \r\nBut on this night, there was plenty not to like from each side. \r\n \r\nNeil celebrating like a wrestler in WWE after beating up Travis Moen in the line brawl wasnâ€™t terribly impressive, nor was Ryan White''s two-handed slash at Zack Smith, which ignited the line brawl. \r\n \r\n"[White] takes a two-handed chop at the back of the playerâ€™s leg -- havenâ€™t seen that in a long time in the National Hockey League," MacLean said. "But thatâ€™s hockey. Stuff happens. I thought we handled ourselves well under the circumstances in the duress we were put under. We defended ourselves." \r\n \r\nIt added salt to the wounds of the Canadiens, thatâ€™s for sure. On a night when the Habs were beaten to loose pucks, beaten in the bodychecking department and beaten on the scoreboard, they were also beaten up by the Senators in that line brawl. \r\n \r\n"It is what it is. Emotions are flying high out there," Neil said. "We stood our ground. \r\n \r\n"We came out tonight, we came hard, we had some hits, everyone finishing checks and thatâ€™s what it takes to win," Neil added. \r\n \r\nMontreal winger Max Pacioretty says the third-period ugliness reflects the emotions of a playoff series both teams desperately want to win. \r\n \r\n"Weâ€™re not going to back down from anyone," he said. "We got a lot of guys that will stick up for their teammates, and it showed. But we have to find a way to compete to get more on the scoreboard in the next game. Thatâ€™s when guys like me have to look in the mirror." \r\n \r\nAnd thatâ€™s just it. Forget for a second the craziness of the third period and think about why the Senators have a series lead. That Canadiens forecheck of Game 2 was nonexistent Sunday night. Their ability in Game 2 to make Craig Anderson''s life more difficult by crashing the goalieâ€™s crease never really happened, either. \r\n \r\nThe Senators dominated at both ends of the ice and the Habs are left to ponder just how their game disappeared from Friday night. \r\n \r\n"We know we have a much better team in here than we showed," Pacioretty said. "Weâ€™re hoping to show up in Game 4." \r\n \r\nThey have no choice if they want to have any chance to win this series.', 'he spotlight on this night should have been squarely on Jean-Gabriel Pageau, an unheralded product from just across the river, whose hat trick propelled the Ottawa Senators to a full-value cream job of the Montreal Canadiens.

(21, '2013-05-06 17:34:56', 'Hockey', 'images/image16.jpg', 'Wild win a huge payback for suffering fans', 'ST. PAUL, Minn. -- On a day when life was breathed back into the State of Hockey, it turned out to be the kid from Newport Beach, Calif., who did the resuscitating. \r\n \r\nGo figure. \r\n \r\nIn what now ranks as one of the most important victories in franchise history, rookie Jason Zucker delivered the Minnesota Wildâ€™s first home playoff victory in more than five years, snapping home the overtime winner just 2:15 into the extra session Sunday to give the Wild a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. \r\n \r\nThe Blackhawks still lead the series 2-1 with Game 4 set for Tuesday, but for a host of reasons, Sundayâ€™s game was a significant test of character for the Wild and a huge payback for a fan base that might have wavered in recent years but has never let go its love affair with the team. \r\n \r\n"Itâ€™s been a long time coming. And it was an entertaining game, an exciting game. Obviously, an overtime win is always great at home but in the playoffs and youâ€™ve been waiting for so long, itâ€™s very big," said center Matt Cullen, who was born in Virginia, Minn., and returned home to play for the Wild in 2010. \r\n \r\n"Itâ€™s been a long time coming, and Iâ€™m a Minnesotan, so I know how long people have been waiting for playoff hockey. Itâ€™s a lot of fun," said Cullen, who was one of the Wildâ€™s players, setting up the winning goal by shoveling a pass to Zucker from his belly behind the Blackhawk net. \r\n \r\nAfter playing by far their best game of the series with a vigorous forecheck and more physical play, it looked like the Wild was actually going to slide into playoff oblivion. Holding onto a 2-1 lead late into the third period, the Wild lapsed into a passive mode, allowing the Blackhawksâ€™ Duncan Keith to blast home the tying goal with 2:46 left in regulation. \r\n \r\n"Yup, that sucked," Zach Parise acknowledged. \r\n \r\nHad the Blackhawks finished the job in overtime to take a commanding 3-0 series lead, it would not have been a surprise to anyone, even the 19,238 holding their collective breaths in the Xcel Energy Center when the extra session opened. \r\n \r\n"It didnâ€™t matter how we got there, whether the whole period was tied 2-2 or whether they got one late, you canâ€™t let that bother you. I think that was a little bit of the message between the third period and overtime," Parise said. \r\n \r\nOne of two key additions made by the Wild last offseason to help rejuvenate the stagnant franchise -- Parise and defenseman Ryan Suter signed identical 13-year deals worth $98 million last July 4 -- Parise had been frustrated by his lack of production as the Wild dropped the first two games in Chicago. He had zero points and was minus-three heading into Game 3 but scored on a backhand Sunday to give the Wild the 2-1 lead that looked for a long time like it would stand as the deciding marker. \r\n \r\nLike Cullen, Parise is a Minnesotan and his desire to play in his home state was one of the key factors in his decision to leave New Jersey, where heâ€™d played his whole career. \r\n \r\nHe said the vibe in the building was special, different on Sunday. \r\n \r\n"Theyâ€™ve been patiently waiting for a playoff team here. And we finally got one, got a team into the playoffs and then, most importantly, in the first game, you get a big win," Parise said. "You get the excitement and hopefully you carry that over into the fourth game. Like I said, the energy in the building was awesome and when we got the winning goal it was so loud, it was great." \r\n \r\nBefore Game 3, head coach Mike Yeo acknowledged he wasnâ€™t sure how his team would respond after dropping Game 1 in overtime and then being crushed 5-2 in Game 2. But on Sunday it resembled the team that had for the middle part of the shortened regular season challenged Vancouver for the Northwest Division lead. The Wild outshot the Blackhawks 37-27 and outhit them 34-13. \r\n \r\nAnd when it looked like all that hard work might be for naught, they found a way to reward not just their fans but themselves with a key win and what was the teamâ€™s first home playoff win since April 11, 2008. \r\n \r\n"I think, at the end of the day, they deserved to win the game," Keith said. \r\n \r\n"They were a little quicker than us tonight. I think our strength is using our speed and our skill and we need to use our speed. We didnâ€™t use it enough tonight." \r\n \r\nAfter the game, as many teams do, the Wild gathered near center ice to salute the fans with upraised sticks. On this day the gesture seemed to carry more meaning. \r\n \r\n"Obviously, it''s pretty special. Definitely for these fans but for our team too," said rookie Charlie Coyle, who picked up the primary assist on the Parise goal, his second assist in the series. \r\n \r\n"We have a good group of guys in here. Weâ€™ve been working all season -- this is the result we want, this is where we wanted to be at the end of the season and weâ€™re just going to keep going from here."', 'On a day when life was breathed back into the State of Hockey, it turned out to be the kid from Newport Beach, Calif., who did the resuscitating.

(22, '2013-05-06 17:37:39', 'Football', 'images/image17.jpg', 'Tough market for veterans', 'One of the hardest things to handle about life in the NFL is the cruel reality of aging. The NBA can find jobs for past-their-prime veterans like Grant Hill, Juwan Howard and Kurt Thomas. The Colorado Rockies didn''t see a problem with having 49-year-old Jamie Moyer on the mound last season.\r\n\r\nPro football, however, is an entirely different beast. Even productive players can have a hard time making a living once they''ve reached certain points in their respective careers.\r\n\r\nThat fact has never been truer than this offseason. This is the first year that owners have to abide by the salary cap rules hammered out in the most recent collective bargaining agreement -- most notably, franchises have to spend at least an average of 89 percent of the cap in contract dollars over the next four years -- and it''s quite apparent where they aren''t spending their money. There are plenty of seasoned, big-name free agents still sitting on the open market, hoping to find homes. Here''s a look at the best of that bunch -- and their chances of staying in the league a little longer.\r\n\r\n1. Charles Woodson, S: It''s amazing that Woodson hasn''t drawn more suitors. He''s had a phenomenal career as a cornerback and he''s talented enough to be as effective at safety as Hall of Famer Rod Woodson was in the final years of his career.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Woodson''s age (36) is working against him despite his lengthy list of accomplishments with Green Bay over the past seven seasons (four Pro Bowls and NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2009). The San Francisco 49ers were the only team to show serious interest in Woodson earlier this offseason. Now that they''ve used a first-round pick on LSU safety Eric Reid, it looks like they''ve found their replacement for departed free-agent safety Dashon Goldson.\r\n\r\nPrediction: The best Woodson can hope for is a minor role on a team that could use a veteran presence in its secondary. He''d likely want to play for a contender, and every team with glaring needs in that category (including New England, Baltimore, San Francisco and Houston) addressed those issues through the draft or free agency. It''s not hard to see Woodson retiring given the way his offseason is going. He has too much pride.\r\n\r\n2. Brian Urlacher, MLB: You would''ve thought the Bears would''ve found a way to allow Urlacher to finish his career with the only team he''d ever known during 13 NFL seasons. The Baltimore Ravens made that happen with Ray Lewis, even though he clearly wasn''t the same superstar he''d been for the last few years of his career.\r\n\r\nInstead, Urlacher and the franchise couldn''t agree on a deal, and now he''s twisting in the wind. Bears general manager Phil Emery has implied that he wasn''t closing the door on Urlacher''s return, but Chicago already has signed middle linebackers D.J. Williams and James Anderson.\r\n\r\nPrediction: The best place for Urlacher would''ve been in Chicago. The next-best spot would be Minnesota since it runs a similar 4-3 scheme and lost starting middle linebacker Jasper Brinkley to free agency. But the Vikings haven''t done anything more than chat with Urlacher''s agents (and they also appear ready to give the job to Erin Henderson, the team''s weakside linebacker from last season). This doesn''t look good for Urlacher at this stage. He may have played his last NFL game.\r\n\r\n3. Casey Hampton, NT: Hampton would still be in Pittsburgh if the Steelers'' salary cap problems weren''t so massive. Instead, he was one of a handful of big names that vanished from the roster for financial reasons. The question is why more teams didn''t jump on him as soon as he hit the open market.\r\n\r\nGranted, Hampton will turn 36 this September. But he''s also spent most of the past 13 years being a key factor in a Pittsburgh run defense that annually ranked among the best in the league. Given the number of teams still running 3-4 schemes -- and Hampton proving this past season that he has some gas left in his tank -- somebody should have signed him by now.\r\n\r\nPrediction: New Orleans made sense until the Saints selected mammoth Georgia nose tackle John Jenkins in the third round of this year''s draft. A return to Pittsburgh now seems more plausible, especially since the Steelers don''t have great options at that position and Hampton remains jobless.\r\n\r\n4. Dwight Freeney, DE: Freeney found himself in the wrong place at the worst possible time last season. For all the success the Indianapolis Colts enjoyed in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year, he suffered through arguably the lousiest season of his 12-year career (five sacks in 14 starts).\r\n\r\nFreeney has a rÃ©sumÃ© that is impressive enough to generate curiosity (107.5 career sacks). What he also has is the same undersized frame that always fit best in the Colts'' Cover 2 defense designed by former coach Tony Dungy. Freeney''s quickness and explosiveness made him a star in that scheme. His age (33) make him a potential liability at this point in his career.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Freeney is past the point of being an every-down player. If he can''t convince teams that he''s dangerous enough to be a situational pass-rusher, his market is nonexistent. Tennessee has shown interest and Denver has listened to the pleas of former Colts teammate and current Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning. The other big question is whether Freeney is willing to work for less than he thinks he''s worth. If he can, Denver seems like the smart bet, especially with Elvis Dumervil now playing in Baltimore and the Broncos having the AFC''s best team.\r\n\r\n5. Brandon Lloyd, WR: The 31-year-old Lloyd had a solid season in New England this past year (74 receptions, 911 yards, four touchdowns) but salary cap issues forced the Patriots to dump him earlier this offseason. So where is the love? This is the same man who made the Pro Bowl in 2010 with Denver, when he led the NFL in receiving yards. Lloyd also has managed to turn his career around over the past few years after being such an underwhelming journeyman that he was checking into college football analyst jobs as recently as 2009. The Patriots liked his contributions, but the signings of Michael Jenkins (a 10-year veteran who caught 34 fewer passes last season) and Donald Jones essentially make his return a long shot.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Lloyd is still young enough and productive enough to find a home. His days of being a No. 1 option are over, but he could be a dependable third or fourth receiver. The problem is that older receivers who fall into that category and don''t play special teams look far less attractive to general managers. He''ll need to find a contender who needs depth at receiver. With that in mind, Cincinnati and Minnesota would be smart to take a look.\r\n\r\n6. John Abraham, DE: Abraham recently became so frustrated with his free-agent process that he indicated he might retire by tweeting "Retiring 13" and "Done" a few days ago. He has since deleted those tweets, but you get the picture. This is a 35-year-old man who expected to have a few more options after producing 10 sacks with Atlanta in 2012 (and 122 in 13 seasons). Abraham falls into the same category as Freeney -- a productive pass-rusher who will have to be a situational player going forward.\r\n\r\nPrediction: It''s clear that Abraham and Freeney are competing for work in the same places, and that Freeney is more attractive to suitors at this point. Despite meeting with a few contenders (including Denver, Seattle and New England), it looks like Abraham should stay off Twitter a little longer. There is no good news coming his way until Freeney makes his decision.\r\n\r\n7. Kyle Vanden Bosch, DE: When Detroit released the 34-year-old Vanden Bosch earlier this offseason, the impact of that move was most felt within the Lions'' locker room. The Lions signed him in 2010 to help change their losing culture and he showed his younger teammates what professionalism and accountability can do for a career. Vanden Bosch essentially made about $20 million with the Lions by being a good guy who could still play. Don''t expect him to be so lucky going forward.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Vanden Bosch had just 3.5 sacks in 2012 and wasn''t nearly as effective off the edge. It''s time to call it a career.\r\n\r\n8. Karlos Dansby, ILB: At 31, Dansby is still young enough to help somebody''s defense. The issue is whether he''s humble enough to accept much less money than he''s been making lately. His last team, Miami, gave him a five-year deal worth $43 million in 2010, and they just released him in March. The Buffalo Bills were talking to him before the draft, but then they used a second-round pick on linebacker Kiko Alonso.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Dansby will be a player somewhere this coming season. It''s just a matter of how much a team will offer him.\r\n\r\n9. Quentin Jammer, CB: With 11 seasons behind him, Jammer will have a hard time finding work as a cornerback. He struggled in coverage with San Diego last season and he''s never become the star some expected when he was selected fifth overall in the 2002 draft. The likeliest scenario has him moving to safety -- he''s always been physical enough to play that spot -- and helping a defense with his ability to handle tight ends from that position. He''s basically a lesser version of Charles Woodson at this stage.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Jammer has met with the Washington Redskins, but nothing appears imminent there. Still, his versatility -- especially at a time when teams need cover safeties more than ever -- should land him a job. That said, the Redskins actually look like the best option for Jammer, solely because neither party has better alternatives.\r\n\r\n10. Daryl Smith, OLB: Here''s another player who should have more of a market. Smith is only 31 and he had been a standout in Jacksonville for most of his nine years with the Jaguars. The most appealing quality for him is his versatility; he can play all three linebacker spots in a 4-3 scheme. The downside: He''s coming off a groin injury that limited him to 10 games in 2012.\r\n\r\nPrediction: Smith met with St. Louis prior to the draft, but the Rams ultimately used a first-round pick on Georgia linebacker Alec Ogletree. There will be more teams who come forward in the coming weeks, but like other players on this list, Smith will have to accept less money to keep working.', 'Teams must spend money, but they aren''t spending it on experience'),

(24, '2013-05-06 23:58:28', 'Football', 'images/image19.jpg', 'Dont Overlook AFC North', 'Much has been made about the amazing buildup of the NFC West, but some attention should go to the AFC North.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the NFC West has become the most improved division in football over the past couple of years. The Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers are drawing support in Vegas and in polls as being the No. 1 teams in football. The St. Louis Rams are much improved. The Arizona Cardinals might be a .500 team if Carson Palmer stays healthy.\r\nThe Baltimore Ravens, Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals didn''t draw the headlines for what they did during the offseason, but their work has been solid.\r\n\r\nRavens general manager Ozzie Newsome faced the bigger challenge. Even though the Ravens won a Super Bowl, they recognized problems. Ray Lewis told them early enough last season that he was going to retire.\r\nThat started the front office working. As they do every year, Newsome and his staff started planning for the the offseason by November. They recognized the aging problem at safety. They knew the team was declining as a run-stopping unit.\r\nSix defensive starters and pass-rushing specialist Paul Kruger were going to be potential targets for replacement. The Ravens also didn''t know then if they had the cap room to retain wide receiver Anquan Boldin.\r\nKruger became too expensive, and the Ravens accepted that. What they didn''t know is that linebacker Dannell Ellerbe would become a $7 million player, but the Miami Dolphins made it impossible for the Ravens to re-sign him. They also couldn''t afford cornerback Cary Williams and safeties Ed Reed and Bernard Pollard.\r\nNewsome and company did an amazing job replacing lost parts. Defensive ends Chris Canty and Marcus Spears will help the run-stopping problems. They lucked into the signing of linebacker Elvis Dumervil. Michael Huff adds athleticism at safety. Rolando McClain was only a $700,000 gamble at linebacker, but the Ravens drafted linebacker Arthur Brown in the second round, too. The team also feels good about first-round pick Matt Elam at safety.\r\n"Matt really picked up things quickly. The same for Arthur Brown," Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after rookie minicamp Sunday. "Matt really did a nice job of communicating in the back end, which is not usual for a rookie. Most rookie defensive backs, even all defensive players, have a tough time with the communication part of it because they aren''t confident enough to make the calls. He''s smart. He picked it up quickly."\r\n\r\nThe Steelers held their rookie minicamp and liked what they saw of outside linebacker Jarvis Jones and halfback Le''Veon Bell. Third-round choice Markus Wheaton adds speed at wide receiver.\r\nThe Pittsburgh front office felt as though the team''s 8-8 last year was indicative of the talent. Now, the Steelers feel as though the offseason helped to reload them for a playoff run.\r\nAs for the Bengals, who have their rookie minicamp next week, they concentrated on keeping their own. They re-signed 10 of their 19 unrestricted free agents. They had a nice draft. With back-to-back trips to the playoffs, the Bengals are ready to make the next step to see if they can win the division.\r\nFrom the inbox\r\nQ: As a Lions lifer, I''m sure you can understand that I have a hard time putting faith in the front office. If the Steelers, Giants, Ravens or any other organization with a track record of developing talent had drafted Ezekiel Ansah, I''d get the Jason Pierre-Paul comparisons. But these are the Lions. And if he''s a project, can he really be counted on to contribute to an aspiring playoff contender right away? Please give me a reason to feel good about this pick.\r\n\r\nWill in Detroit\r\nA: Ansah has great potential and the Lions have demonstrated a great ability to pick defensive linemen. Plus, head coach Jim Schwartz has a good grasp of talent along the defensive line. He has worked with Bill Belichick and Jeff Fisher. I think you can put their trust in them. The Lions needed a pass-rushing defensive end. Schwartz has a scheme that should allow Ansah to do well. One player doesn''t take a team to the playoffs, but Ansah is a player who can help this team. I''d feel good about it if I were you.\r\n\r\nQ: Everyone says that the Bills selecting quarterback EJ Manuel was a total surprise? If so, why was he in New York for the draft? Who decides who is invited? That a player is at the draft, wouldn''t it be a sign to everyone that someone was looking at drafting him in the first or second round?\r\nGregory in San Jose, Calif.\r\nA: The NFL helps to make that decision. They go over the possibilities of the player going in the second round. If the agent sees a problem, he wouldn''t allow his player to be in New York. Speaking afterward, Manuel said he had a feeling the Bills would take him, so he didn''t have a problem being there. Because anything can happen in a draft, there was no guarantee he was going to be taken in the first round, but he was willing to gamble. As you can see from Geno Smith, who slipped into the second round, it''s still a guessing game. This year''s draft was more of a guessing game than most.\r\nQ: The NFL puts a high emphasis on the importance of the left tackle position, presumably to protect a QB''s blind side. But what about a team that has a left-handed QB such as the Eagles'' Michael Vick. Does that switch the importance to the right tackle, or are there reasons other than protecting the blind side to be considered?\r\nRyan in Columbus, Ohio\r\nA: It is important, which is why Lane Johnson should help at right tackle during his rookie season. Jason Peters will hold down the left tackle position. Because Vick scrambles so much and is still quick, there often isn''t a precise launching point for the quarterback as there would be for a pocket passer such as Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. The reason left tackles are so important to right-handed quarterbacks is the left side is the blind side. Running quarterbacks often have to have their heads on swivels.\r\nQ: Everyone knows the different personnel needed for the front seven of a defense depends on whether the team runs a 3-4 or a 4-3, but is the play style of safeties and corners different in a 3-4 than it is 4-3?\r\nCaleb in Morgantown, W.Va.\r\nA: The difference is slight, but there tends to be a little more zone defense in the 3-4. On early downs, the safety tends to help more in the box in the 3-4, giving the defense eight players near the line to stop the run. The 3-4 tends to do a better job against the run. Safeties in the 4-3 might need a little more range. They don''t have that fourth linebacker in front of them. Regardless, in both systems, safety is an important position.\r\nQ: Why do you think Brandon Lloyd is still out there? He won''t cost a lot and there are so many teams that have a need, especially with the uncertainty of rookie receivers.\r\nCraig in Las Vegas\r\nA: Good question. He is one of the best players out there. In fact, I think he would help out the New York Jets. One of the problems could be that he has been in so many places and been with so many teams, some may shy away from him. I''d be surprised if he doesn''t have a job in the next week or two. He''s got to be atop a lot of lists for available wide receivers. Even though he was considered a failure in New England last year, he still caught 74 passes for 911 yards. That''s a lot of production.\r\nQ: Why is it seen as a bad situation for a quarterback to be drafted to a team with an established starter (Ryan Nassib and Landry Jones)? Aaron Rodgers sat for three years and is now arguably the top QB in the NFL. Wouldn''t it be better to be drafted by a good team such as the Giants or Steelers rather than going to a project like Buffalo?\r\nJames in Jackson, Miss.\r\nA: Learning is great, but playing is better. It''s hard to adjust to being a backup. Think about how hard it is for Ryan Mallett or any of these backups and playing behind quarterbacks who start 16 games. No one wants to sit for four years without playing. Football is a competitive sport. You don''t want to give that up. It hurts from the football sense. It hurts from the economic sense. Sure, it worked out well for Rodgers, but talk to him about how tough it was.\r\nQ: I''m trying to figure out the Eagles'' QB situation. I know we don''t know what Chip Kelly will actually run. But if, as I think he will, he runs an offense much like the Patriots do but without as many deeper routes and with less time spent in the pocket, which QB fits best? I''m assuming it will be some system where a majority of the plays have no routes over 20 yards and the QB has to read the defense, find an open receiver in the first few seconds -- whether it''s a quick screen or slant or crossing route -- and if the first couple looks are covered, the QB just scrambles for whatever handful of yards the defense gives him. I feel like Nick Foles looked slow in running but quick in reading and decision-making, so wouldn''t he be the top option on the team? How hard is it to improve a professional athlete''s speed to where it would just be average (not necessarily an asset like Vick''s, but right now it''s a bit of a detriment to Foles)?\r\nBrian in Reading, Pa.\r\nA: Because the offense is fast-paced and run-based, I think Michael Vick has the significant edge. I don''t think he will do a bad job. Vick''s game has always been based on speed. I think he can make good, quick decisions. Tom Brady doesn''t fit the mode of what you would expect of a quarterback trying to run the Oregon offense. Brady is not quick with his feet. He''s a pure pocket passer. Still, he made Kelly''s style of offense work well because of his quick decision-making ability.\r\nQ: You say "one of the weird parts of the draft was what happened at tight end," given the four top TEs taken went to teams with already solid starting TEs. I''m not sure why you think that''s weird. You always hear sports pundits say "the NFL is a copycat league." Aren''t these teams simply doing what other teams in the NFL have been doing for years and trying to emulate the Patriots? Having seen what two strong TEs on the field together can do, that would make a lot of sense, no?\r\nThomas in London\r\nA: I just found it as a weird trend in this particular draft. Most of the teams drafting in the first two rounds drafted for needs. While there is a growing emphasis on getting two-tight-end talent, I just found it interesting that more teams that didn''t have that No. 1 tight end didn''t take one or two of these tight ends for need. Three of those top draft choices at tight end went to teams that had starters who played more than 90 percent of the snaps. Most of those teams had decent slot receivers. It will be fascinating to see how these tight ends are used as rookies.', 'Much has been made about the amazing buildup of the NFC West, but some attention should go to the AFC North.'),
